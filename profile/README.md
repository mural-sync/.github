# Mural

Mural is a program that allows you to synchronize a wallpaper slideshow across your devices. It supports having multiple different slideshows (called pools). For example, you might have a pool called "Games" for wallpapers related to games and a pool called "Landscapes" for wallpapers of beautiful landscapes.
